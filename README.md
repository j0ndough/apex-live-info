# apex-live-info
Script that gets the current map rotation in Apex Legends.

Will probably add command-line arguments and/or support for continual updates soon.

May be repurposed into a Discord bot or something later, TBD.

## Usage

First, register for an API key [here](https://apexlegendsapi.com/).

Rename `config.cfg` to `api_config.cfg` and paste your API key into the `CLIENT_ID` field.

Run `main.py` to get a list of maps for each game mode printed to the terminal.
